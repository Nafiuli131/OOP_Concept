***Constructor***

----> Constructor is used for initialization of an object. 
Suppose we have a class student{
String name;
String roll;
}

we need to use constructor here to initialize name and roll value there.

----> How to create constructor?
Student(String name,int roll){
this.name = name;
this.roll = roll;
}


----> return type is not applicable for constructor

----> If we use void Student(String name,int roll){

} then it'll be a mothod not a constructor.

----> Every class have a default constructor. And compiler create default constructor.

----> Default constructor::
Student(){
super();
}

----> super() must be called to the first statement in the cnonstructor

----> this must be called to the first statement in the cnonstructor

----> we use super and this only in constructor. it's not possible to use those in method

----> super means calling parent constructor and this means calling the current class constructor
